## Overview

We understand that life happens and sometimes you need to reschedule. Our cancellation policy is designed to be fair to both students and instructors while ensuring everyone gets the most out of their learning experience.

### Private Lessons

**24-hour notice required** for all cancellations. Lessons cancelled with proper notice can be **rescheduled at no charge** within the same billing period.

- **Same-day cancellations**: Will be charged the full lesson fee
- **Emergency situations**: Contact us immediately - we'll work with you on a case-by-case basis
- **Rescheduling**: Subject to instructor availability within your billing cycle

### Group Sessions & Programs

**Group sessions are non-refundable** if missed without 24-hour notice. This policy exists because:

- Group dynamics depend on consistent attendance
- Other students rely on your participation
- Instructors prepare specific content for each session

**Program cancellations**: If you need to withdraw from a multi-week program, please contact us as soon as possible to discuss options.

### Recording Sessions

**48-hour notice required** for recording session cancellations due to:

- Studio booking commitments
- Engineer scheduling requirements
- Equipment preparation time

### Refund Policy

Refund policies vary by program type:

- **Individual lessons**: Unused lessons can be refunded with 48-hour notice
- **Program packages**: Prorated refunds available within the first two weeks
- **Recording services**: Deposits are non-refundable within 48 hours of session

### Weather & Emergency Situations

In case of severe weather or emergency situations:

- We will contact you if lessons need to be cancelled
- All weather-related cancellations will be rescheduled at no charge
- Virtual lesson options may be available as an alternative
