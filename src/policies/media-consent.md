## Special Considerations

### Performance Events

**Public Performances**: Recitals and showcases may be attended by family and friends who may take their own photos/videos. While we encourage respectful photography, we cannot control audience members' personal documentation.

### Recording Sessions

**Musical Recordings**: If you're recording original music or covers, we can help you understand your rights regarding the recordings themselves (separate from promotional photos/videos of the recording process).

### Social Media Tags

**Student Social Media**: If students post about their lessons and tag us, we may share or repost content with appropriate credit, following platform terms of service.
