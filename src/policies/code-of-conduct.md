## Our Commitment

We believe in creating a **supportive and inclusive learning environment** where every student can thrive and develop their musical talents. Our code of conduct ensures that everyone feels welcome, respected, and safe.

### Core Principles

**Respect**: Treat all members with dignity and courtesy, regardless of their skill level, background, or musical preferences.

**Inclusivity**: Welcome diversity in all its forms. Music brings people together, and we celebrate the unique perspectives each person brings to our community.

**Punctuality**: Arrive on time for all scheduled sessions. Being punctual shows respect for instructors and fellow students' time.

**Preparedness**: Come ready to learn and participate. Bring your instrument, materials, and a positive attitude to every session.

**Safe Use of Gear**: Handle all equipment with care. Our instruments and recording equipment are valuable resources that benefit everyone when properly maintained.

### Expected Behavior

- Listen actively and respectfully during lessons and group sessions
- Support fellow students in their learning journey
- Communicate concerns or issues directly with instructors
- Follow safety guidelines for all equipment and facilities
- Maintain a positive, encouraging atmosphere

### Reporting Concerns
