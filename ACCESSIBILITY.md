- ✅ Transform animations disabled in reduced motion mode

### 7. WCAG 2.2 Specific Improvements

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test skip link (Tab on page load, should focus "Skip to main content")
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
- [ ] Test focus indicators are visible and high contrast
- [ ] Test mobile navigation with keyboard
- [ ] Test all forms can be completed with keyboard only
- [ ] Test back-to-top button functionality

### Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver (macOS) or NVDA/JAWS (Windows)
- [ ] Verify all content is announced properly
- [ ] Check form labels are read correctly
- [ ] Verify navigation structure is clear
- [ ] Test accordion and collapsible content

### Browser Dev Tools
- [ ] Run Lighthouse accessibility audit (aim for 95+ score)
- [ ] Check for accessibility violations in console
- [ ] Test with high contrast mode enabled
- [ ] Test with different zoom levels (up to 200%)

### Color Contrast Testing
- [ ] Verify all text meets WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large)
- [ ] Test with various color vision simulations
- [ ] Check button and link contrast in all states

### WCAG 2.2 Specific Testing
- [ ] Test Focus Appearance: Focus indicators are clearly visible on all backgrounds
- [ ] Test Focus Not Obscured: Tab through page, ensure no focused elements are hidden by header
- [ ] Test Target Size: All clickable elements are at least 24x24px (use browser dev tools)
- [ ] Test on mobile: Touch targets are at least 44px and don't cause unwanted zoom

## Browser Support
The accessibility improvements support:
- Modern browsers with CSS custom properties
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, etc.)
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High contrast mode
- Reduced motion preferences
- Mobile assistive technologies

## Known Limitations
- Some decorative floating icons are purely visual (properly marked as `aria-hidden`)
- Gradient text may not work in older browsers (gracefully degrades)
- Some animations are simplified in reduced motion mode

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add more detailed alt text for any images added
- [ ] Consider adding audio descriptions for video content
- [ ] Implement automatic form validation feedback
- [ ] Add language selection if multi-language support is needed
