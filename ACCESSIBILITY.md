## Overview
This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to ensure the website meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provides an excellent experience for all users, including those using assistive technologies.

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure
- ✅ Added proper HTML5 landmark elements (`header`, `main`, `footer`, `nav`, `section`, `article`)
- ✅ Added `role` attributes for clarity (`banner`, `main`, `contentinfo`, `menubar`, `menuitem`)
- ✅ Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3) throughout all pages
- ✅ Used `article` elements for program cards and content blocks

### 2. Keyboard Navigation
- ✅ Added skip link to jump to main content (Press Tab on page load)
- ✅ Enhanced focus indicators with high contrast outlines
- ✅ All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- ✅ Focus management for mobile navigation (handled by Bootstrap)
- ✅ Back-to-top button with keyboard support

### 3. ARIA Attributes and Labels
- ✅ Added `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` for sections and complex UI
- ✅ Added `aria-describedby` for form fields with helper text
- ✅ Added `aria-current="page"` for active navigation links

- ✅ Proper form label associations with unique IDs
- ✅ External links marked with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- ✅ Screen reader friendly button and link descriptions
- ✅ Hidden honeypot fields properly marked as `visually-hidden`

### 5. Color Contrast Improvements
- ✅ Improved primary colors for better contrast ratios:
  - Primary blue: `#2563eb` (was `#3b82f6`)
  - Secondary red: `#dc2626` (was `#ef4444`)

### 6. Motion and Animation Preferences
- ✅ Added `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- ✅ Animations disabled for users who prefer reduced motion
- ✅ Smooth scrolling disabled when motion is reduced
- ✅ Maintained visual hierarchy without relying on motion

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test skip link (Tab on page load, should focus "Skip to main content")
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
- [ ] Test focus indicators are visible and high contrast
- [ ] Test mobile navigation with keyboard
- [ ] Test all forms can be completed with keyboard only
- [ ] Test back-to-top button functionality

### Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver (macOS) or NVDA/JAWS (Windows)
- [ ] Verify all content is announced properly
- [ ] Check form labels are read correctly
- [ ] Verify navigation structure is clear
- [ ] Test accordion and collapsible content

### Browser Dev Tools
- [ ] Run Lighthouse accessibility audit (aim for 95+ score)
- [ ] Check for accessibility violations in console
- [ ] Test with high contrast mode enabled
- [ ] Test with different zoom levels (up to 200%)

### Color Contrast Testing
- [ ] Verify all text meets WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large)
- [ ] Test with various color vision simulations
- [ ] Check button and link contrast in all states

## Browser Support
The accessibility improvements support:
- Modern browsers with CSS custom properties
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, etc.)
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High contrast mode
- Reduced motion preferences
- Mobile assistive technologies

## Known Limitations
- Some decorative floating icons are purely visual (properly marked as `aria-hidden`)
- Gradient text may not work in older browsers (gracefully degrades)
- Some animations are simplified in reduced motion mode

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add more detailed alt text for any images added
- [ ] Consider adding audio descriptions for video content
- [ ] Implement automatic form validation feedback
- [ ] Add language selection if multi-language support is needed
