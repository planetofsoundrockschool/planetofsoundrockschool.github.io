- [ ] Merge to main branch after testing

## Overview

This is the Planet of Sound Rock School website - a static site built with Eleventy (11ty) and deployed to GitHub Pages. It showcases a four-tier music education program in London, Ontario.

## Development Commands

### Core Commands
- `npm install` - Install all dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with live reload and file watching
- `npm start` - Start development server (same as dev)
- `npm run build` - Build the site for production (outputs to `_site/`)

### Development Workflow
- Run `npm run dev` for local development - this watches for changes and auto-reloads
- The dev server typically runs on http://localhost:8080
- All source files are in the `src/` directory
- Built files output to `_site/` directory (ignored in git)

## Architecture

### Site Structure
- **Static Site Generator**: Eleventy (11ty) using CommonJS configuration
- **Template Engine**: Nunjucks (.njk files) for all pages and layouts
- **Content**: Pure HTML/Nunjucks templates with YAML front matter
- **Markdown Usage**: Only for specific content sections managed through DecapCMS components
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5.3.3 via CDN + SCSS compiled to custom CSS
- **Navigation**: Uses `@11ty/eleventy-navigation` plugin for automated navigation
- **CSS Architecture**: SCSS with organized structure (abstracts, base, components, layout)

### Directory Structure

```

### Content Management
- Each page is a Nunjucks (.njk) file with YAML frontmatter
- Navigation is configured via `eleventyNavigation` in frontmatter
- All pages extend `base.njk` layout
- Site uses semantic HTML with Bootstrap classes
- Markdown is only used for specific content sections in DecapCMS components

### Styling System
- **CSS Variables**: Custom properties defined in `:root` for brand colors
  - `--rock-red: #e74c3c`
  - `--rock-dark: #2c3e50` 
  - `--rock-orange: #f39c12`
- **Component Styling**: Custom classes for hero sections, cards, buttons with hover effects

- **Output**: `_site/` directory contents served at GitHub Pages URL

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Pages
1. Create new `.njk` file in `src/`
2. Add YAML frontmatter with `layout: base.njk`, `title`, `description`
3. Include `eleventyNavigation` if it should appear in main navigation
4. Write content in HTML/Nunjucks templating
5. Use component data from DecapCMS when appropriate

### Modifying Styles
- **SCSS Architecture**: Edit SCSS files in `src/scss/` directory structure
  - `abstracts/_variables.scss`: Brand colors, breakpoints, and design tokens
  - `base/_dark-theme.scss`: Dark mode theming and color overrides
  - `layout/_header.scss`: Navigation, mobile menu, and header styling
  - `components/`: Reusable component styles
- **CSS Output**: SCSS compiles to `src/css/style.css`
- **Variables**: Use existing SCSS variables and mixins from abstracts layer
- **Responsive Design**: Use provided mixins (`@include mobile-only`, `@include large-desktop-up`)
- **Dark Mode**: Add corresponding dark theme styles in `_dark-theme.scss`
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Extend Bootstrap classes with custom SCSS
- **Testing**: Test across all breakpoints and both light/dark modes

### Content Updates
- Program information is in `src/programs.md` and `src/index.md`
- Pricing details in `src/pricing.md`
- Contact information in `src/contact.md`
- All content uses consistent Bootstrap component structure

### Working with DecapCMS Components
The site uses a **component-based approach** where Decap CMS manages individual content pieces that are assembled by templates:

#### Accessing the CMS
- Navigate to `/admin/` on the live site to access DecapCMS interface
- Requires GitHub authentication and repository write access
- Changes are committed directly to the repository main branch

#### Available Content Types
1. **Site Settings** (`src/_data/site.json`): Global site configuration
2. **Main Pages**: Full page content for major site sections
3. **Program Data** (`src/_data/programs/`): Individual program information cards
4. **Pricing Data** (`src/_data/pricing/`): Service pricing and lesson types
5. **Policy Components** (`src/_data/policies/`): Individual policy cards and sections

#### Component-Based Policy System
The policies page demonstrates the component approach:
- **Individual Policy Files**: Each policy is a separate JSON file (e.g., `code_of_conduct.json`)
- **Template Assembly**: The `policies.md` template loops through and renders all policies
- **Flexible Structure**: Each policy can have different fields (points, sections, areas)
- **Visual Styling**: Policies can use different card styles (light, warning, primary, secondary)
- **Ordering**: Policies are sorted by `order` field for consistent display

#### Adding New Component Types
1. **Update DecapCMS Config**: Add new collection in `src/admin/config.yml`
2. **Create Data Structure**: Define JSON schema for the component
3. **Update Templates**: Modify page templates to loop through and display components
4. **Test Workflow**: Ensure CMS interface works and data displays correctly

#### Template Data Access
In Nunjucks templates, access CMS data via:
```nunjucks
{%- for policy in policies -%}  {# Loops through all policy files #}
{{ policies.code_of_conduct.title }}  {# Accesses specific policy file #}
{{ programs.learn_to_play.price }}   {# Accesses program data #}
```

#### Benefits of Component Approach
- **Non-technical Updates**: Staff can update content without touching code
- **Consistent Styling**: Templates ensure uniform presentation
- **Flexible Content**: Easy to add/remove/reorder components
- **Version Control**: All changes tracked in Git with full revision history
- **Preview Mode**: DecapCMS preview shows changes before publishing

### Local Development
- Use `npm run dev` for development with live reload
- CSS and JS files are watched for changes
- Static assets are copied from `src/assets/`, `src/css/`, `src/js/`
- Test builds locally with `npm run build` before deploying
