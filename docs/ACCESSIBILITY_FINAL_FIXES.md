# Final WCAG 2.2 AAA Accessibility Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ Privacy Text Contrast Issues
**Problem**: "We respect your privacy. Unsubscribe at any time." text was failing contrast requirements
**Solution**: 
- **Homepage Newsletter**: Changed from `opacity-75` to `text-white` for full white text on gradient background
- **Footer Newsletter**: Changed from `text-muted` to `text-light` for better contrast on dark background
- **CSS Enhancement**: Added specific contrast rules with `!important` declarations and text shadows

**Result**: Both instances now meet WCAG AAA 7:1 contrast requirements

### 2. ‚úÖ Contextual Help Text Always Visible
**Problem**: Help text was always displayed, creating visual clutter and cognitive overload
**Solution**:
- **CSS**: Help text hidden by default with `display: none` and smooth transitions
- **JavaScript**: Enhanced contextual help system that shows help on:
  - Form field focus (`focus-within`)
  - Form group hover
  - Help icon click/keyboard activation
  - Manual toggle via JavaScript

**Result**: Clean interface with contextual help that appears only when needed

### 3. ‚úÖ Placeholder Text Accessibility Issues  
**Problem**: Textarea had placeholder text which can be problematic for screen readers
**Solution**:
- **Removed placeholder** from contact message textarea
- **Removed placeholder** from newsletter email inputs
- **Enhanced aria-label** attributes for clearer field descriptions
- **Added hidden help text** connected via `aria-describedby`

**Result**: Form inputs rely on proper labels and descriptions instead of placeholder text

### 4. ‚úÖ Form Structure Enhancement
**Problem**: Form fields lacked proper grouping for contextual help system
**Solution**:
- **Wrapped fields** in `.form-group` containers
- **Enhanced CSS** to support `focus-within` and hover states
- **Updated JavaScript** to work with form-group structure
- **Added autocomplete** attributes for better UX

**Result**: Proper form field grouping with working contextual help system
